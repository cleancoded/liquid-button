1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - don't just copy this code and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done whatsoever - that's REALLY being a dick.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content - that would make you a TOTAL dick.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works and services, share the love. Only a dick would make bank off this work and not buy the original work's creator(s) a beer.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and complaining when it doesnâ€™t work as expected makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
